# GIT-IT
Project
=================
Highlights the dependencies among the definitions and theorems 
in "GÃ¶del Without (Too Many) Tears" by Peter Smith 
(see https://www.logicmatters.net/igt/godel-without-tears/)

More specifically, I explain (to myself for now) the proofs of 
Godel's incompleteness theorems by adding links between the 
statement of theorems and definitions and between definitions.

Eventually, I also want to highlight the dependency links among
the theorems in Peter Smith's document.
